# <Challenge_1>

## Description

 I  worked with this project to apply my knowledge gained durring modual 1, I also used a little from the second modual I learned more about display flex (spicificly with how I orginized the main block of content into two parts) The process of dividing the page really confused me. Now ill be the first to admit I messed up I didnt see the style.css file so I remade it. the code is commented out as I didnt have the heart to delete my work and it helped me understand it, but it wasnt the right task.  Im glad I made this mistake as it helped me develup a further understanding  of modual 1 and a little bit of 2!
